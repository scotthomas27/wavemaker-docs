## Introduction

Wavemaker is designed to be a convenient and full-featured novel writing software.
It is, and will remain, free and open-source.

The software can be installed locally and used offline or access via a web interface.
Both versions can be configured to sync to Google Drive.

### Development

Wavemaker is developed by [Iain Wood](https://github.com/mayasky76), who began working on it in 2016.
The [@wavemaker](https://github.com/wavemakercards) project has had multiple release iterations since then.
The latest release is [Version 4](wavemakercards.com).
