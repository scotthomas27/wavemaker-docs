## Introduction

Wavemaker is designed to be a convenient and full-featured novel writing software.
It is, and will remain, free and open-source.

The software can be installed locally and used offline or access via a web interface.
Both versions can be configured to sync to Google Drive.

### Development

Wavemaker is developed by [Iain Wood](https://github.com/mayasky76), who began working on it in 2016.
The [project](https://github.com/wavemakercards) has had multiple release iterations since then.
The latest release is [Version 4](wavemakercards.com).

## Features

Wavemaker includes various tools intended to make planning and writing your novel as easy as possible.

There is no *correct* way to use Wavemaker.
It is intended to be used the way YOU want to use it.
While the writing tools do work together, you may prefer to just use one or two of them independently.

The sections below cover the writing tools included in Wavemaker in more detail.


### Writer

The Writer tool is the text editor built into Wavemaker.
It includes various formatting options including **bold** and *italics*, images and quotes.
A sidebar allows you to create tagged notes and attach them to the page you are working on. [^1]

### Grid planner

The Grid planner allows you to create a grid of color-coded, tagged and labelled notes that may assist you with planning out the events in your novel.
This tool is connected to the Writer tool; your timeline events can be imported into the Writer as separate pages.

### Mindmaps

The Mindmap tool helps you visualize how the various concepts in your novel connect with each other.

This tool is not connected to any other.
