== Sidebars

Within this sidebar you can create new sections by clicking on one of the two icons at the top of the sidebar.
A new section can either be a _child_ (image:../images/new-child-section.png[New child,16]) or _sibling_ (image:../images/new-sibling-section.png[New sibling,16]) to the section currently open in the Writer.
Child sections are nested below the parent section while sibling sections are on the same level.

You can reorder the sections by dragging the section icon to the desired location.
You can also delete sections by clicking on the `x` icon that becomes visible to the right of any section when you hover your cursor over it.

You can pin sidebars open with the pin icons at the top left and top right of the writer page.

The left sidebar contains links to the various pages in your manuscript.
The right sidebar is a Card manager.
It allows you to create Cards for, or link existing Cards to, this page.
