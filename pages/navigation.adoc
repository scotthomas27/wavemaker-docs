image::../images/wm-settings.png[Settings box]

== Save File

This option will save the current project to your device.
The file will be in a Wavemaker-unique `.wm4` file.
The default naming convention for these files is the project name and the date and time of export in the following format:

[source.copy]
----
Name-of-Project[YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS].wm4
----

You can, of course, rename this file (do not alter the file extension) and save it in a location of your choosing.

== Google Drive

If you have not used this option before, clicking this icon for the first time will open a dialogue box with a *pass:[[Login to Google Drive]]* button.

Clicking this button will open a dedicated browser window for you to log into Google Drive (if you are not already logged-in) and authorise Wavemaker to make changes to your account.

This permission is required to save files to Drive.
