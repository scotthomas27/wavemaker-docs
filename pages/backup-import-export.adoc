@Iain: None of the following has been tested as I get an error when trying to connect my Google Drive account.

Wavemaker has native support for Google Drive backups.
There are three ways you can use Google Drive to keep your work backed up and secure:

. Set Wavemaker to automatically sync your work to Drive as you write.
You will be prompted to enable this feature each time you load Wavemaker.

. You can manually sync to Google Drive whenever you choose.
Use the Google Drive icon in the menu bar (image:../images/google-drive-icon.png[Google Drive,width=20,height=20]) to initiate a backup.

. Use the <<Export to file>> instructions below to export your work, then save that file in a location backed up by Google Drive.

== Import from Google Drive

== Export to file

== Import from file
