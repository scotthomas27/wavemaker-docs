@Iain: None of the following has been tested as I get an error when trying to connect my Google Drive account.

Wavemaker has built-in support for Google Drive backups.
There are three ways you can use Google Drive to keep your work backed up and secure:

. Set Wavemaker to automatically save your work to Drive as you write.
You will see a prompt for this feature each time you load Wavemaker.

. You can manually upload your work whenever you choose.
Use the Google Drive icon in the menu bar (image:../images/google-drive-icon.png[Google Drive,width=20,height=20]) to initiate a back up.

. Use the <<Export to file>> instructions below to export your work, then save that file in a location backed up by Google Drive.

== Import from Google Drive

== Export to file

== Import from file
