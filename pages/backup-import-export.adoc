@Iain: None of the following has been tested as I get an error when trying to connect my Google Drive account.

Wavemaker has native support for Google Drive backups.
There are three ways you can use Google Drive to keep your work backed up and secure:

. Set Wavemaker to automatically sync your work to Drive as you write.
You will be prompted to enable this feature each time you load Wavemaker.

@Iain: Is this still the case?

. You can manually sync to Google Drive whenever you choose.
Use the Google Drive icon in the menu bar (image:../images/google-drive-icon.png[Google Drive,width=20,height=20]) to initiate a backup.

. Use the <<Export to file>> instructions below to export your work, then save that file in a location backed up by Google Drive.

== Load a file from Google Drive

== Load a file from your Device

== Import a Wavemaker Version 3 file

== Export a .doc file of this manuscript

This option, found on the main page of your manuscript, will export a `.doc` version of your work.

After clicking this button you will be prompted to name your exported file (be careful not to overwrite the `.doc` extension) and choose where on your local device to save it.
