## Introduction

Wavemaker is designed to be a convenient, cross-platform and full-featured novel writing software solution.
It is, and will remain, free and open-source.

It can be installed locally and used offline or accessed via a web interface in any browser on any operating system.

It can sync to Google Drive directly or manuscripts can be exported and imported (allowing you to use any backup option you prefer).

### Development

The [project](https://github.com/wavemakercards) has had multiple release iterations since it began in 2016.
The latest release is [Version 4](wavemakercards.com).
