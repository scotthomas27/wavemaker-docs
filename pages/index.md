## Introduction

Wavemaker is designed to be a convenient, cross-platform and full-featured novel writing software solution.
It is, and will remain, free and open-source.

It can be installed locally and used offline or accessed via a web interface in any browser on any operating system.

It can sync to Google Drive directly or manuscripts can be exported and imported (allowing you to use any backup option you prefer).

### Development

Wavemaker is developed by [Iain Wood](https://github.com/mayasky76).
The [project](https://github.com/wavemakercards) has had multiple release iterations since it began in 2016.
The latest release is [Version 4](wavemakercards.com).

## Features

Wavemaker includes various tools intended to make planning and writing your novel as easy as possible.

There is no _correct_ way to use Wavemaker.
It is intended to be used the way **you** want to use it.

While some of the writing tools listed below do work together, you may prefer to just use one or two of them independently.

### Writer

The Writer tool is the text editor built into Wavemaker.
It includes various formatting options including **bold** and *italics*, images and quotes.
A sidebar allows you to create tagged notes and attach them to the page you are working on.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: ***NOTE:*** _@mayasky76, has the 'Focus mode' gone away?._

### Grid planner

The Grid planner allows you to create a grid of color-coded, tagged and labelled entries that may assist you with planning out the events in your novel.

The axes of the grid are entirely arbitrary; they can be whatever you need them to be (the passage of time or different sub-plots, for example).

### Mindmaps

The Mindmap tool helps you visualize how the various concepts in your novel connect with each other.

### Snowflakes


### Timelines

This tool is connected to the Writer tool; your timeline events can be imported into the Writer as separate pages.


### Cards


### Search


### Focus mode


### Pinning

What are the pins to either side of the writing pane?


### I18n

When you first access Wavemaker, you will see a drop-down menu pre-populated with a locale language code.
Clicking on the down arrow on this menu will reveal the language options available in Wavemaker.

The language options at the time of release are:

1. English (en)
2. Deutsch (de)
3. Espanol (es)
4. Francaise (fr)
5. Cymraeg (cy)
