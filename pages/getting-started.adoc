= Getting started

When you load Wavemaker 4 for the first time, you will see a welcome screen that presents you with your options:

image::../images/welcome-screen.png[Welcome screen]

The documentation in this section will discuss these options in more detail.

== Creating a new project

If you choose the first option, *New project*, you will be taken to the 'Project Home' screen.

Here you can name your manuscript in the 'My Project Name' field.

Below the Project name field is a series of links to the Wavemaker tools.

You can return to the Project Home screen at any time by clicking the 'Home' icon in the top bar.

== Load a file from Google Drive

// tag::import-from-drive[]
If you have previously saved a Wavemaker 4 project in Google Drive, you can use this option to reload that project file into Wavemaker.

The file must have the `.WM4` or `.wm4` file extension to be recognised by Wavemaker.

If you have previously saved a file to your local computer, you can use this option to reload it into Wavemaker.

The file must have the `.WM4` or `.wm4` file extension to be recognised by Wavemaker.
// end::import-from-device[]

== Import a Wavemaker Version 3 file

// tag::import-wm-v3[]
If you are migrating from Wavemaker Version 3, you can use this one-time conversion tool to import a locally-saved Wavemaker 3 database into Wavemaker 4.

.To create a Wavemaker 3 database file:

. Log into Wavemaker version 3 at https://wavemaker.cards/

. Navigate to the main page if you are not there already.

. Under the 'Manage Your Projects' heading, click the green 'Download Database' button beside the 'Full Database Backup' option:
+

. In the download window, choose location and a name for your backup.
By default the name is `wavemaker-<HH-MM-DD-MM-YYYY>.wmdata` (where `HH-MM-DD-MM-YYYY` represents the time and date of the export).

.To import a Wavemaker 3 database file:

. Click the *Import a Wavemaker Version 3 file* option from the Project Home screen.

. Read the information presented on the next screen.

. Click the *Upload a wavemaker database* button.

. Navigate to, and select, the appropriate `.wmdata` file.

. Select which project you would like to import.

NOTE: If you have multiple projects in Wavemaker 3 that you would like to import into Wavemaker 4, you must repeat the above process for each project, saving each as a Wavemaker 4 `wm4` file (either locally or in Google Drive) before importing the next one.

@Iain; I can't seem to get back to the welcome screen once I've imported a project unless I close that project (which clears it from the database).

Therefore I cannot import more than one project at a time, regardless of if I import them from `.wm4` or `.wmdata` files.
Is this intended or a bug?

Also, some of the projects in my `.wmdata` file simply refuse to import. I click on them in the presented list and nothing happens. This seems to happen with older projects. Re-opening in WM3, re-saving, re-exporting and re-importing into WM4 doesn't seem to make any difference.
