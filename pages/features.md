# Features

Wavemaker includes various tools intended to make planning and writing your novel as easy as possible.

There is no _correct_ way to use Wavemaker.
It is intended to be used the way **you** want to use it.

While some of the writing tools listed below do work together, you may prefer to just use one or two of them independently.

## Manuscripts

The Writer tool is the text editor built into Wavemaker.
It includes various formatting options including **bold** and *italics*, images and quotes.
A sidebar allows you to create tagged notes and attach them to the page you are working on.

## Grid planner

The Grid planner allows you to create a grid of color-coded, tagged and labelled entries that may assist you with planning out the events in your novel.

The axes of the grid are entirely arbitrary; they can be whatever you need them to be (the passage of time or different sub-plots, for example).

## Mindmaps

The Mindmap tool helps you visualize how the various concepts in your novel connect with each other.

## Snowflakes

## Timelines

This tool is connected to the Writer tool; your timeline events can be imported into the Writer as separate pages.

## Cards

## Search

## Focus mode

## Pinning

What are the pins to either side of the writing pane?

## I18n
