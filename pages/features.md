# Features

Wavemaker includes various tools intended to make planning and writing your novel as easy as possible.

There is no _correct_ way to use Wavemaker.
It is intended to be used the way **you** want to use it.

While some of the writing tools listed below do work together, you may prefer to just use one or two of them independently.

## Writer

The Writer tool is the text editor built into Wavemaker.
Think of it as a Word Processor _Lite_.
It includes the following formatting options:

- **bold**
- _italics_
- ~~strikethrough~~

It supports inserting headings (up to four deep), images, bulleted and numbered lists and quotes.

Other buttons include a _jump to bottom_ button, undo and redo.

![Writer bar](../images/writer-bar.png)

A sidebar to the left shows the sections (or pages or chapters) of your manuscript.

Within this sidebar you can create new sections by clicking on one of the two icons at the top of the sidebar.
A new section can either be a _child_ (<img src="../images/new-child-section.png" alt="New child" width="16"/>) or _sibling_ (<img src="../images/new-sibling-section.png" alt="New sibling" width="16"/>) to the section currently open in the Writer.
Child sections are nested below the parent section while sibling sections are on the same level.

You can reorder the sections by dragging the section icon to the desired location.
You can also delete sections by clicking on the `x` icon that becomes visible to the right of any section when you hover your cursor over it.


A sidebar to the right of the page allows you to create tagged cards and attach them to the page you are working on.
Cards are discussed in more detail in the next section.

### Cards

## Grid planner

The Grid planner allows you to create a grid of color-coded, tagged and labelled entries that may assist you with planning out the events in your novel.

The axes of the grid are entirely arbitrary; they can be whatever you need them to be (the passage of time or different sub-plots, for example).

## Mindmaps

The Mindmap tool helps you visualize how the various concepts in your novel connect with each other.

## Snowflakes

## Timelines

This tool is connected to the Writer tool; your timeline events can be imported into the Writer as separate pages.

## Cards

## Search

## Focus mode

## Sidebars

You can pin sidebars open with the pin icons at the top left and top right of the writer page.

The left sidebar contains links to the various pages in your manuscript.
The right sidebar is a Card manager.
It allows you to create Cards for, or link existing Cards to, this page.

## I18n

When you first access Wavemaker, you will see a drop-down menu pre-populated with a locale language code.

The language options at the time of release are:

1. English (en)
2. Deutsch (de)
3. Espanol (es)
4. Francaise (fr)
