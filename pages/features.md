# Features

Wavemaker includes various tools intended to make planning and writing your novel as easy as possible.

There is no _correct_ way to use Wavemaker.
It is intended to be used the way **you** want to use it.

While some of the writing tools listed below do work together, you may prefer to just use one or two of them independently.

The Writer tool is the text editor/word processor built into Wavemaker.

It includes **bold**, _italic_ and ~~strikethrough~~ text formatting.
It supports inserting headings and subheadings, images, bulleted and numbered lists and quotes.
It also includes a link to the [Grid Planner](#grid-planner) and a [focus mode](#focus-mode).

![Writer bar](../images/writer-bar.png)

A sidebar to the left shows the sections (or chapters) of your manuscript.
This sidebar is discussed in more detail in the [Navigation](navigation.md) section.

A sidebar to the right of the page allows you to create reference [cards](#cards) and attach them to the page you are working on.
These cards are discussed below.

Both sidebars can be pinned open for easy access or unpinned for a larger editing page.

## Cards

The Cards feature ties many of Wavemaker's tools together.
Cards created in one part of the software, the Writer sidebar, for example, appear in other parts of the software, such as the Grid Planner.

They can be coloured and tagged to assist with sorting and identification.

The image below shows the new card interface:

Cards are a powerful tool that allows pertinent textual or visual details to be readily available when you need them.
They can be sorted, tagged and coloured in any way that makes sense to you.

## Planning boards

Planning boards allow you to create a grid of colour-coded, tagged cards that may assist you with planning out the events in your novel.
Each column in the grid corresponds to a section in your manuscript.
The cells in each column are the cards attached to that section.

To create a new board from the home page,...
To create a new board from within Wavemaker,...

The board works in conjuction with the writer; you can create cards in the Writer siebar that will automatically populate a corresponding column in the associated Planning board.
Likewise, you can create a Planning board full of detailed cards and Wavemaker will automatically create matching sections in the Writer tool. Each column in the board becomes linked to a section with the same title. Any notes in the column will be automatically attached to the sidebar of the corresponding section.

From the Writer sidebar, you can use the pop-out button to open the grid planner in its own window, allowing you ease of reference without cluttering the Writer interface.

## <img src="../images/mindmap-icon-blk.png" alt="Mindmap icon" width="36"/> Mindmaps

The Mindmap tool helps you visualise how the various concepts in your novel connect with each other.

To create a new mindmap from the home page, select the _Your Mindmaps_ entry and then click the Mindmap icon at the top right.

To create a new mindmap from within Wavemaker, click the Wavemaker icon at the top left of the page and select the Mindmap icon from the dropdown menu.

Once in a mindmap, use the icons to the top left to create new nodes, either image or text, and the style of link between them.

To move a node around within the mindmap, select it and drag using the directional icon at the right of the node.

To link two nodes together, select one of the nodes you want to link and then click on the _chain_ icon at the bottom right of the node.
Do the same to the other node in the link.
A line, in your selected style, will appear between the two.
Either of the linked nodes can now be moved freely around the mindmap space and the link will be maintained.

Remove links by clicking on them.
They will turn red on cursor hover and disappear when click.
